# Python Advent of Code 2021

My attempt at [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) using
Python.

All solution code should be put in `days`. The filename for each day should be
`day_xx.py`.

All input should be put in `data`. The filename for the real input of each day
should be `day_xx_input.txt`, and test input `day_xx_test_input.txt`.

To run a given day, do `python3 days/day_xx.py data/day_xx.txt`. python3.9 or
greater is required.
